(1, "When you wake up from a good dream, you feel the reality is harsh. When you wake up after a bad dream, you will be sentimentally attached to the beauty of reality. But as long as life is good, reality and dreams don't matter."),
(2, "The Shawshank Redemption has great performances, extremely well written script and story all leading to a deeply emotional climax! One of the best dramas of all time!"),
(3, "Quite simply, the greatest film ever made. Humour, sadness, action, drama and a Vietnam film all rolled into one.I'm not a stone cold, heartless villain, but it takes a lot to make me cry when I watch a movie. Bambi's mother, I couldn't care less. Jimmy Stewart in, Oh, what a wonderful life, - yeah right! The Lion King, when Mufasa bites the big one - on the verge."),
(4, "Everything about Fight Club is simply amazing. \n
The acting, the directing, and the story is simply superb.\n
However, going into this film I had already had had some of the major twists spoiled for me, and this is a movie that relies so heavily on those twists that knowing them will detract from the experience significantly. \n
Because of that, the film is really only worth seeing of you have no prior knowledge of it whatsoever.");
